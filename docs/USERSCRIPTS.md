These addons are obsolete. The functionality is now directly built into the plugin.

This userscript adds a tooltip to the checkboxes indicating the row (e.g. user name) and column (e.g. permission).

## Jenkins Role Strategy Role Management Enhancer and Jenkins Role Strategy Role Assignment Enhancer

These userscripts rotate the text in the column title cells on the Role Strategy configuration pages by 90 degrees so they use less horizontal space. 
Additionally, the first (header) column is repeated at the end of the table.
