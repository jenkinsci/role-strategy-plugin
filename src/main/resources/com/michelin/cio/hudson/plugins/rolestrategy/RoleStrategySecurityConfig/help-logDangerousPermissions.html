<div>
  <p>When creating a Role, the plugin checks for some dangerous permissions.
    By default, when a dangerous permission is detected, the plugin would throw a SecurityException.
    This can prevent some other plugins like configuration as code to export the configuration.</p>
  <p>In any way, these dangerous permissions will not be included in the permission set created by the PermissionHelper.</p>
  <p>Check this box to log a warning instead of throwing a SecurityException.
