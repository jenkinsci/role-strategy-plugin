migrate_user=Migrate ambiguous permissions assignment to user {0}
migrate_group=Migrate ambiguous permissions assignment to group {0}

promptUser=User name:
userExists=An entry for this user already exists
emptyUser=Please enter a user name

promptGroup=Group name:
groupExists=An entry for this group already exists
emptyGroup=Please enter a group name

ambiguous=This table contains rows with ambiguous entries. This means that they apply to both users and groups of the specified name. \
  If the current security realm does not distinguish between user names and group names unambiguously, and if users can either choose their own \
  user name or create new groups, this configuration may allow them to obtain greater permissions. \
  It is recommended that all ambiguous entries are replaced with ones that are either explicitly a user or a group.
