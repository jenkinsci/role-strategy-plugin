<div>
  On the assign roles page, the entered names are checked in the background if they do exist and if it is a user or a group.
  This is done serially by default, which can take a lot of time (>10min for 300 users) when the security realm (e.g. Active Directory or LDAP) is slow and many users/groups
  are added to the roles.<br/>
  By increasing this value, the users/groups are checked in parallel.<br/>
  Also check if the security realm offers caching of users (e.g. AD has this) and enable it.
  <h5>Warning</h5>
  Increasing this value to more than 5 without using http2 can have side effects as browsers limit the number of parallel connections to the same site.
  By using <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/initial-settings/#using-http2">HTTP/2</a> for Jenkins a significant reduction of the total time to check all names
  can be expected with a higher value.
