<div>
    Returns a list of all item roles of the user that started the build. This includes roles assigned via groups.
    When the run is triggered by an SCM event or by the timer, the build usually runs as the <em>System</em> user. This user is
    considered as having all roles.<br/>
    You can use the <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/authorize-project/" target="_blank">Authorize Project</a> plugin
    to run the builds as a different user. When running as <em>anonymous</em>, an empty list is returned.
