  <p>
    The pattern is used to match item names (jobs, agents, folders, etc.).
    This means that the permissions you are assigning to this role will only be valid for an item 
    having a name matching this pattern.<br>
    Item names in Jenkins are case-insensitive while agent names are case-sensitive. Adding <b>(?i)</b>
    to the start of the pattern will make it case-insensitive.
